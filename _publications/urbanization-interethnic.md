<u>Abstract</u>: This paper explores the role of rapid urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa on interethnic marriage, a measure of social cohesion. We exploit cross-country data from the Demographic Health Surveys and link them to urbanization on the local level using standardized geodata from the Global Human Settlements project. Comparing marriages within the same locality at different levels of urbanization, we find that urbanization has a robust positive effect on intermarriage, increasing in magnitude with the degree of urbanization. We then explore potential mechanisms using a matching model that allows for trade-offs between spousal education and ethnicity in urban and rural marriage markets. <br><br>
