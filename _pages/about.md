I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [Department of Economics and Management](https://www.uni.lu/fdef-en/research-departments/department-of-economics-and-management/) at the University of Luxembourg and part of the [ACROSS Doctoral Training Unit](https://sites.google.com/view/fredericdocquier/xingb-blog/across). 

My research interests are in applied microeconomics, with a focus on migration, gender, and development.
